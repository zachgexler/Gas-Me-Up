## Technologies Used

## Future Updates


*Find an API that has up-to-date pricing (that is free to use)
*Create a table/text box/something for the returned data to display in that is more visually appealing.
*I would love the API to have more data to be able to pull from (like a flag or map and display the currency sign being used and date of data)
*Connect better the theme of fossil fuels and finding another home
*Expand on the connection between the moon Titan and earth's oil reserves.
