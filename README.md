## Gas Me Up

Gas Me Up is a web app used to pull gasoline and diesel prices from specific countries. The prices are in local currency, however extremely outdated.

## Technologies Used

*WOG API
*HTML5
*CSS3
*Bootstrap
*JavaScript
*jQuery


## Future Updates


*Find an API that has up-to-date pricing (that is free to use)
*Create a table/text box/something for the returned data to display in that is more visually appealing.
*I would love the API to have more data to be able to pull from (like a flag or map and display the currency sign being used and date of data)
*Connect better the theme of fossil fuels and finding another home
*Expand on the connection between the moon Titan and earth's oil reserves.

## Unsolved Problems
A major problem I had was not understadning the value/point/aspect of using the terminal and git add/commit/push, which hindered my timeline. Problem is resolved now, but was a large error during the project. I tried to find/use other gasloine APIs for pulling more current prices and more information but I couldn't get the keys to work. I didn't know how/take the time to better understand how I could've encapsulated the returned data without disrupting the bg image or any functionalities.

## Favorite
Understanding fundamentals enough to create a working product, and I love the visuals I was able to add.
